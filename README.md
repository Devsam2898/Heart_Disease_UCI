# UCI Heart Disease Dataset

This dataset contains data related to heart disease diagnoses. It is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes various medical attributes and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The target variable (`num`) has the following values:

- 0: No heart disease
- 1: Heart disease

The dataset contains the following features:

1. `age`: Age of the patient
2. `sex`: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
3. `cp`: Chest pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
4. `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
5. `chol`: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
6. `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
7. `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
8. `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
9. `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
10. `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
12. `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. `thal`: Thallium stress test result (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)

## Usage

You can use this dataset for tasks related to heart disease prediction, classification, and exploratory data analysis. The dataset can be loaded into various machine learning frameworks and libraries, such as Python's scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, for further analysis.
